{"name":"Bio2RDF","tagline":"Linked Life Science Data","body":"# Bio2RDF\r\nBio2RDF provides access to biological, chemical, and other scientific databases using semantic web technologies to provide common references for linked life science data.\r\n\r\n## RDF conversion scripts\r\nThe Bio2RDF community has created [scripts to convert scientific databases to RDF](https://github.com/bio2rdf/bio2rdf-scripts). These conversions scripts utilise the common Bio2RDF URIs to link between data items within and across databases.\r\n\r\n## Vocabulary mappings\r\nThe Bio2RDF community has created [vocabularies](https://github.com/bio2rdf/bio2rdf-mappings) to standardise properties that are used in the RDF conversions process.\r\n\r\n## SPARQL endpoints\r\nThe Bio2RDF community provides a number of publicly available copies of the databases that are generated by the RDF conversion scripts. These are available as [SPARQL endpoints](http://download.bio2rdf.org/release/2/release.html) using the Virtuoso Open Source database.\r\n\r\n## Web application\r\nThe Bio2RDF.org website is powered by the [QueryAll Linked Data Server](https://github.com/ansell/queryall). The configuration and template files used by Bio2RDF are available [here](https://github.com/bio2rdf/bio2rdf-webapp).\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nBio2RDF was created by Fran√ßois Belleau (@fbelleau) and Marc Alexandre Nolin. The scripts and databases are maintained by Michel Dumontier (@micheldumontier), Alison Callahan (@alisoncallahan), Jose Cruz-Toledo (@jctoledo) and Dana Klassen (@dklassen). Peter Ansell (@ansell) maintains the Web Application. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThe [Bio2RDF Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/group/bio2rdf) provides an easy way to discuss issues with the Bio2RDF community.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
